# Key-Value database paradigm

Databases structured almost like JSON or Python dictionaries. Each key is unique.

## Uses

- Most often theyâ€™re used as a cache to reduce data latency. Apps like Twitter, GitHub, and Snapchat all use Redis for real-time delivery of their data.

- There are other use cases beyond caching, like Message queues, pub-sub, and gaming leaderboards, but more often than not, key-value databases are used as a cache on top of some other persistent data

## Databases

- Redis
- MEMcached
