# Key-Value database paradigm

- Databases structured almost like JSON or Python dictionaries.
- Each key is unique.
- Data stored in memory, not disk, so it's extremely fast.
- Simplest way to use a database (3 commands: set, get & delete).

## Uses

- Real-time data delivery.
- Cache on top of some other persistent data (like messages, gaming leaderboard, ...)

## Databases

- Redis
- MEMcached
