# Wrapped tokens

## Definition

Wrapped tokens are a way to use cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Dogecoin
on blockchains other than the blockchain they were originally built on.

Wrapped tokens are backed 1:1 by their underlying asset, which is stored in a
digital vault.


## Purpose

Wrapped tokens are a solution to the problem of blockchain interoperability.


## Example

Some wrapped tokens:
- WBTC (Bitcoin)
- WETH (Ether)
- WBNB (BNB)
- renDOGE (Dogecoin)
