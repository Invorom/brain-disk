# Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

## Liquidity

Liquidity refers to how easily one asset can be converted to another without
causing a drastic change in the asset's price.

Crypto currencies with low liquidity are assets where each trade will have a
big impact on the token/coin's price.

On the other hand, crypto currencies with high liquidity are assets where each
trade will have a small impact on the token/coin's price.


### Pool

A liquidity pool is a bunch of crypto currencies locked in a smart contract.


### Provider

A liquidity provider is someone who funds a liquidity pool with crypto assets.

It facilitate trading on the platform and in return, the provider earn passive
income on his deposit.
