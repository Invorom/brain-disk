# Ethereum


## What?

Ethereum is blockchain with smart contract functionality.


## When?

It was conceived in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin and released the July 30th 2015.
Also, Ethereum should get a major update in June 2022.


## Why?

For Vitalik Buterin, blockchains could benefit from other applications besides
money. Moreover, it needed a more robust language for application development,
in order to link real-world assets such as stocks and property, to the
blockchain.

### ERC-20

The ERC-20 (Ethereum Request for Comments 20), proposed by Fabian Vogelsteller
in November 2015, is a Token Standard that implements an API for tokens within
Smart Contracts.

Example functionalities ERC-20 provides:
- transfer tokens from one account to another
- get the current token balance of an account
- get the total supply of the token available on the network
- approve whether an amount of token from an account can be spent by a
third-party account
